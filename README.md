A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that automatically generates tools from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, allowing MCP Clients (e.g. Claude Desktop) to interact with any REST API.

## Features

- üîÑ **Automatic Tool Generation**: Converts OpenAPI specs into callable MCP tools
- üîê **Multiple Authentication Types**: Bearer tokens, API keys, Basic auth, or no auth
- üéØ **Path Filtering**: Include/exclude specific API endpoints using regex patterns
- üåê **Flexible Spec Loading**: Supports both JSON and YAML OpenAPI specifications
- üîí **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management with `${VAR_NAME}` expansion
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure by Default**: Only GET (read-only) operations enabled by default

## Quick Start with Petstore API

The easiest way to get started is with the Swagger Petstore demo API:

### 1. Create Configuration File

Create `petstore-config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  name: "petstore-demo"
openapi:
  spec_url: "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
authentication:
  type: "none"
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "petstore": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-this-openapi",
        "--config-path",
        "/path/to/your/petstore-config.yaml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Try it in Claude

Once configured, you can ask Claude things like:

- "What pet operations are available?"
- "Get information about pet with ID 1" 
- "Show me the pet store inventory"

**üîí Security Note**: By default, only `GET` (read-only) operations are enabled for safety. To enable write operations, you must explicitly specify them:

```yaml
server:
  name: "petstore-demo"
openapi:
  spec_url: "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
authentication:
  type: "none"
include_methods:
  - GET
  - POST  # Explicitly enable creating resources
  - PUT   # Explicitly enable updating resources
```

## Configuration Reference

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
server:
  name: "my-api-server"  # Name displayed in Claude

openapi:
  spec_url: "https://api.example.com/openapi.json"  # OpenAPI spec URL

# Authentication is optional - omit for no authentication
authentication:
  type: "none"  # Explicit no authentication (same as omitting this section)
```

### Authentication Options

#### No Authentication
```yaml
# Option 1: Omit authentication section entirely (recommended)
# No authentication section needed

# Option 2: Explicit none type
authentication:
  type: "none"
```

#### Bearer Token
```yaml
authentication:
  type: "bearer"
  token: "your-bearer-token"
  # Or use environment variable:
  # token: "${API_TOKEN}"
```

#### API Key
```yaml
authentication:
  type: "api_key"
  api_key: "your-api-key"
  header_name: "X-API-Key"  # Optional, defaults to "X-API-Key"
  # Or use environment variable:
  # api_key: "${API_KEY}"
```

#### Basic Authentication
```yaml
authentication:
  type: "basic"
  username: "your-username"
  password: "your-password"
  # Or use environment variables:
  # username: "${API_USER}"
  # password: "${API_PASS}"
```

### Path and Method Filtering

Control which API endpoints and HTTP methods are exposed as tools:

```yaml
server:
  name: "filtered-api"

openapi:
  spec_url: "https://api.example.com/openapi.json"

authentication:
  type: "none"

# Include only user and repo related endpoints
include_patterns:
  - "^/users"
  - "^/repos"

# Exclude admin endpoints
exclude_patterns:
  - "^/admin"
  - "^/internal"

# Only allow safe read operations
include_methods:
  - GET
  - HEAD

# Or exclude dangerous operations
exclude_methods:
  - DELETE
  - PUT
  - PATCH
```

#### Method Filtering Examples

**üõ°Ô∏è Default Behavior** (automatic, no configuration needed):
```yaml
# GET-only operations are enabled by default for security
# No method filtering configuration needed for read-only access
server:
  name: "safe-api"
openapi:
  spec_url: "https://api.example.com/openapi.json"
```

**Enable Write Operations** (explicit opt-in required):
```yaml
include_methods:
  - GET
  - POST   # Allow creating resources
  - PUT    # Allow updating resources
```

**All Operations** (for full API access):
```yaml
include_methods:
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - DELETE
  - PATCH
```

**Exclude Specific Operations**:
```yaml
exclude_methods:
  - DELETE  # Allow all except delete
```

**Combined Path and Method Filtering**:
```yaml
# Only allow GET operations on user endpoints
include_patterns:
  - "^/users"
include_methods:
  - GET
```

### Environment Variables

Keep sensitive credentials out of your config files:

```yaml
server:
  name: "secure-api"

openapi:
  spec_url: "https://api.example.com/openapi.json"

authentication:
  type: "bearer"
  token: "${API_TOKEN}"  # Will read from environment variable
```

Set the environment variable:
```bash
export API_TOKEN="your-secret-token"
```

## Real-World Examples

### GitHub API Example

```yaml
server:
  name: "github-api"

openapi:
  spec_url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json"

authentication:
  type: "bearer"
  token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"

# Only expose user and repository operations
include_patterns:
  - "^/user"
  - "^/repos"

# Exclude admin operations
exclude_patterns:
  - "^/admin"
```

### Stripe API Example

```yaml
server:
  name: "stripe-api"

openapi:
  spec_url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stripe/openapi/master/openapi/spec3.json"

authentication:
  type: "bearer"
  token: "${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}"

# Only expose safe read operations
include_patterns:
  - "^/v1/customers"
  - "^/v1/products"
  - "^/v1/prices"

# Only allow read operations for safety
include_methods:
  - GET
```
